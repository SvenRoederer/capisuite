TODO (high to low IMHO) 0 bugs = release :)

o check with Paul and Matthias if there's a chance/plan to get
  a libcapi20-2{,-dev} that provides & conflicts libcapi20-dev.
  It's a bit IMHO ugly to build-dep on -dev and runtime pkg to make
  sure the right lib ABI version is available
  
Achim> python2.3-dev depends on python2.3.  no need to specify python.
Daniel> leider baut es ohne nicht auf sparc
